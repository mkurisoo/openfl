# MNIST Classification Tutorial

## I. About the dataset

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits
between 0 and 9. More info at [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).

## II. About the model

We use a simple fully-connected neural network defined at
[layers.py](./workspace/layers.py) file.

## III. How to run this tutorial (without TLC and locally as a simulation):
<br/>

### 0. Activate the virtual environment and navigate to the OpenFL repository:
  - For help with this step, visit the "Install the Package" section of the [OpenFL installation instructions](https://openfl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#install-the-package).
<br/>

### 1. Within the OpenFL repository, navigate to the tutorial:
 ```sh
 cd openfl-tutorials/interactive_api/Tensorflow_MNIST
 ```
 <br/>
 
### 2. Split terminal into 3 (1 terminal for the director, 1 for the envoy, and 1 for the experiment):
   - Ensure proxies are set. If you do not have sudo permissions on your machine, ensure your proxies are set in all terminals.
   - For each terminal, ensure steps 0 and 1 are complete. 
<br/>

### 3. In the first terminal, run the director:

```sh
cd director
./start_director.sh
```
<br/>

### 4. In the second terminal, run the envoy:

```sh
cd envoy
./start_envoy.sh env_one envoy_config_one.yaml
```

Optional: Run a second envoy in an additional terminal:
  - Ensure steps 0 and 1 are complete for this terminal as well.
  - Run the second envoy:
```sh
cd envoy
./start_envoy.sh env_two envoy_config_two.yaml
```
  - Notice that "env_one" was changed to "env_two", and "envoy_config_one.yaml" was changed to "envoy_config_two.yaml"
<br/>

### 5. In the third terminal (or forth terminal, if you chose to do two envoys) run the `Tensorflow_MNIST.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
cd workspace
jupyter lab Tensorflow_MNIST.ipynb
```
